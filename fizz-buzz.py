''' "Fizz buzz" is a word game we will use to teach the robots about
division. Let's learn computers.

You should write a function that will receive a positive integer and
return: "Fizz Buzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and by 5; "Fizz"
if the number is divisible by 3; "Buzz" if the number is divisible by
5;  The number as a string for other cases. Input: A number as an
integer.

Output: The answer as a string.

Example:

checkio(15) == "Fizz Buzz" checkio(6) == "Fizz" checkio(5) == "Buzz"
checkio(7) == "7"

How it is used: Here you can learn how to write the simplest function
and work with if-else statements.

Precondition: 0 < number â‰¤ 1000 '''

def checkio(number):
	if number%15 == 0:
		return "Fizz Buzz"
	elif number%5 == 0:
		return "Buzz"
	elif number%3 == 0:
		return "Fizz"
	return str(number)

nums = list(range(1,1001))
print(list(map(checkio, nums)))
